# SMART Handcut
It is a hand gesture and actions detection application used to perform computer actions. As a trained hand gesture/action is detected, it will perform an equivalent computer actions. Right now it can perform any computer shortcut (which makes it really powerful as it can basically perform all computer actions as long as they have a shortcut binding to it), open files, open website, and type text upon a gesture or action being detected. It is a machine learning and computer vision project

You can see the demo in at youtube (https://youtu.be/nV81TYK7_Pc) the app can actuallly do much more than that (it currently already have 8 gestures trained successfully (which can perform 8 equivalent computer actions) but due to time constraint I can not show it out. But in general it can perform any computer shortcut, open files or open a website upon the trained gesture and actions being detected
